## Neodm

Neodm is a simple social network, using ruby on rails and postgres.   
It uses devise-jwt for authentication, docker for development and production, and rspec for testing.  
By now, this app will only be the backend for a flutter app.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it, you're ready to go!
